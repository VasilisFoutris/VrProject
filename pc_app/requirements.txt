# ============================================
# GPU ACCELERATION (Optional but recommended)
# ============================================
# These packages enable GPU-accelerated encoding for maximum FPS/minimum latency.
# They require NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support.

# CuPy for GPU image processing (choose your CUDA version):
# For CUDA 11.x: pip install cupy-cuda11x
# For CUDA 12.x: pip install cupy-cuda12x
cupy-cuda12x>=13.0.0

# CUDA runtime libraries (for DLL dependencies)
nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12
nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12

# nvJPEG for hardware JPEG encoding (requires NVIDIA GPU):
# NOTE: pynvjpeg has compilation issues on Windows, disabled for now
# pynvjpeg>=0.0.13

# OpenCV with CUDA support (optional, requires building from source):
# opencv-contrib-python does NOT include CUDA - you need to build OpenCV with CUDA manually
# See: https://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d15/tutorial_building_tegra_cuda.html
